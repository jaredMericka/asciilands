	'There is great reward in solitude. There is great reward in the dark. There is great reward under the ground.',
	'These rewards are lonliness, fear and worms respectively.<br>True rewards can be hard to recognise so an open mind is as essential as an open hole through which you can escape when your cave floods.',
	'Flooding is not the only danger down here but it is definitely the most external. My mind is all but lost and as any man knows, the body cannot live without the mind.<br>My body is still alive, though.<br>Weird.',
	'A cactus and a bird and a pancake.'
