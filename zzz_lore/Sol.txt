The people of Sol believed that control of fire would promise them ultimate control and safety both from the elements and their enemies.
Their smiths, the "Sol Smiths" were the greatest in the world and knew the secrets behind the creation of some of the worlds' most coverted materials: Sun steel and Sun ointment.

Sun steel was said to disipate heat extremely well and could not have its tempurature reduced below body tempurature. This made for very comfortable armour and it was used the clad the front of ice-breaking juggernauts. This is what allowed the people of Sol to be the first occupiers of the untamed northlands.

Sun ointment could be applied to leather to make it almost impervious to heat. This is how the Sol smiths made their gloves and aprons.

The greatest smith ever is said to be a decesed Sol smith named "???". His hammer is said to always have glowed hot as he worked. He invented sun ointment and his gloves were imbued with the first mixture.

The weight of his hammer is the basis of the world-over standard measurement of weight - "hammers". A hammer is about 4.5 kgs.
